### 🧠 TL;DR Summaries (Optional)

You can enable the built-in AI summary feature using Google's Gemini models.

1. Create a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Launch the app and press **T** on any article or bookmark.
3. When prompted, paste your API key into the popup and press Enter.
4. The key will be saved automatically in a `.env` file in the app directory.

Once set up, pressing **T** will display a concise summary of the selected article, generated by **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**.
